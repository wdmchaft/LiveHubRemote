Live Hub Remote
===============

A remote control app for the [WD TV Live Hub](http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp?driveid=891)

This app basically mimics the built in web interface remote, which POST's commands to a CGI script that runs on the web server.
If the web interface is disabled on the Live Hub device, this app won't function properly. 

Features
-------------

* Swipe based navigation
* Standard play/pause, forward/back controls, and more
* Uses iPod controls when screen is locked! 

No App Store?
-------------

This app uses the iPod controls to send commands while the screen is locked. 
This feature will almost certainly cause the app to be rejected from the 
App Store, so I'm not submitting it at this time. In the future I may try my
luck, or submit a version with the iPod controls cut out.
